# CRTO

**Repo's objective**: to gather all the info that we’d found useful and interesting for the CRTO. We also collect material from other resources (websites, courses, blogs, git repos, books, etc).

**Before continue**: we are still working on this repo as we go on with our CRTO journey. This means we'll add or remove parts without giving notice. Furthermore, this is not intended to be a comprehensive repo, cross-reference and information gathering are your friends.
